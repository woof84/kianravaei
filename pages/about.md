                    <p>Composer <b>Kian Ravaei</b> (b. 1999) loves notes, and the indescribable feelings they inspire within us. Whether he is composing piano preludes inspired by mythical creatures, flute melodies that mimic the songs of endangered birds, or a string quartet that draws from the Iranian music of his ancestral heritage, he takes listeners on a spellbinding tour of humanityâ€™s most deeply-felt emotions.</p>
                    <p>Ravaeiâ€™s music has been performed by sought-after artists such as guitarist <a href="http://www.eliotfisk.com/" target="blank">Eliot Fisk</a> and violinist <a href="https://www.bellahristova.com/" target="blank">Bella Hristova</a>, and by notable ensembles including <a href="https://www.salastina.org/" target="blank">Salastina</a> and <a href="https://www.juventasmusic.org/" target="blank">Juventas New Music Ensemble</a>. He served as a 2022 <a href="http://www.coplandhouse.org/" target="blank">Copland House</a> CULTIVATE Fellow, participating in a weeklong emerging composers institute at Aaron Coplandâ€™s National Historic Landmark home. In recent months, Ravaei was featured on an episode of <a href="https://www.yourclassical.org/episode/2022/09/29/kian-ravaei" target="blank">Performance Today</a>, Americaâ€™s most popular classical music radio program. His string quartet <i>Family Photos</i> has received numerous awards, including First Prize in the Spectrum Chamber Music Composition Competition, Second Prize in the instrumental chamber music division of the American Prize, and Honorable Mention in the Tribeca New Music Young Composer Competition.</p>
                    <p>Just days into the COVID-19 lockdown, Ravaei began a daily ritual of playing a Bach chorale at the piano and composing an original chorale in response. What started as a way to ground himself during a period of emotional turbulence blossomed into an artistic reawakening. Over the course of one year and three hundred sixty-five chorales, Ravaei cultivated a deeply personal musical language rooted in a centuries-long tradition.</p>
                    <p>Born to Iranian immigrants, Ravaei maintains close ties to the Iranian community in his hometown of Los Angeles (or, as Iranians often call it, <i>Tehrangeles</i>). His multicultural arrangement of the Iranian folk song <i>Morgh-e Sahar</i> â€” the unofficial anthem for Iranian freedom â€” was performed at <a href="https://farhang.org/" target="blank">Farhang Foundation</a>â€™s annual Nowruz celebration, the largest Iranian New Year celebration outside Iran. A passionate speaker, Ravaei delivered a one-hour public lecture on the relationship between music and identity as part of the UCLA Iranian Music Lecture Series. Many of his works combine the ornamented melodies of Iranian classical music with the colorful harmonies of Western classical music.</p>
                    <p>DJs know Ravaei as the go-to person for creating orchestral versions of dance songs. His orchestration of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wooli" target="blank">Wooli</a> & <a href="https://g.co/kgs/JDeesm" target="blank">Codeko's</a> "<a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/works/crazy/">Crazy (feat. Casey Cook)</a>" has garnered over one hundred thousand plays across streaming platforms. It is no coincidence that many of Ravaeiâ€™s concert works contain a rhythmic vitality that evokes the energy of the dance floor.</p>
                    <p>Inspired by the generosity of his own teachers â€” celebrated composers such as <a href="https://www.richard-danielpour.com/" target="blank">Richard Danielpour</a>, <a href="https://www.tarikoregan.com/" target="blank">Tarik Oâ€™Regan</a>, and <a href="http://www.derekbermel.com/" target="blank">Derek Bermel</a> â€” Ravaei pays forward his musical training by empowering youth to embrace their creativity. As a <a href="https://www.laco.org/people/kian-ravaei/" target="blank">Composer Teaching Artist Fellow</a> for the <a href="https://laco.org/" target="blank">Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra</a>, he taught historically underserved students about the diverse and growing repertoire of orchestral music. With Ravaeiâ€™s guidance, the students co-composed a piece of chamber music that was performed by professional musicians, empowering the students to have confidence in their creative voices.</p>
                    <p>Ravaei studied music composition at <a href="https://schoolofmusic.ucla.edu/" target="blank">UCLA</a> and the <a href="https://www.curtis.edu/" target="blank">Curtis Institute of Music</a> Young Artist Summer Program.</p>

                    <p><b>Kian Ravaei</b> <a value="PLAY" onclick="play()">ðŸ”Š</a> composes music that delivers heartfelt directness, bold melodies, and visceral power. His growing body of work has often been praised for combining rigorous compositional technique with naturalness and penetrating emotion.</p>
                    <p>During the first year of the pandemic, Ravaeiâ€™s daily ritual was playing a chorale by J.S. Bach at the piano and composing an original chorale. Three hundred seventy-one chorales later, Ravaei has cultivated a deeply personal harmonic language and an obsession with the art of counterpoint. Like Bachâ€™s chorales, many of Ravaeiâ€™s works appear to be simple on the surface, but underneath they are rich and filled with unexpected nuance.</p>
                    <p>Born in 1999 of Iranian immigrants, Ravaei spent his childhood playing jazz, producing electronic dance music, and singing in a rock band when he should have been practicing piano sonatas. His diverse output has included a book of piano preludes inspired by mythical creatures, a string quartet that synthesizes Western and Persian classical music, and an orchestration for dubstep DJ and producer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wooli" target="_blank">Wooli</a>.</p>
                    <p>Ravaeiâ€™s music has been performed by leading musicians such as violinist <a href="https://www.bellahristova.com/" target="_blank">Bella Hristova</a>, guitarist <a href="http://jijiguitar.com/" target="_blank">JIJI</a>, and pianists <a href="https://www.stefanogreco.com/en/" target="_blank">Stefano Greco</a> and <a href="https://jihyechang.com/" target="_blank">Jihye Chang</a>. He has been commissioned by notable organizations and ensembles such as the <a href="https://cmccanada.org/" target="_blank">Canadian Music Centre</a> and <a href="https://www.salastina.org/" target="_blank">Salastina.</a></p>
                    <p>As of the 2021/22 season, Ravaei is a newly appointed <a href="https://www.laco.org/people/kian-ravaei/" target="_blank">Composer Teaching Artist Fellow</a> with the <a href="https://laco.org/" target="_blank">Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra</a>. He is an alum of the <a href="https://www.curtis.edu/" target="_blank">Curtis Institute of Music</a> Young Artist Summer Program, and he counts prominent composers such as <a href="https://www.tarikoregan.com/" target="_blank">Tarik Oâ€™Regan</a>, <a href="https://www.derrickskye.com/" target="_blank">Derrick Skye</a>, <a href="https://kayrhie.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Kay Rhie</a>, and <a href="https://www.juanpablocontreras.com/" target="_blank">Juan Pablo Contreras</a> among his past mentors.</p>
                    <p>He makes his home in Los Angeles, where he studies music composition with <a href="https://www.richard-danielpour.com/" target="_blank">Richard Danielpour</a> â€” one of his favorite living composers â€” at the UCLA Herb Alpert School of Music. When he is not composing, he likes to jog, read short stories, and collect CDs.</p> -->
