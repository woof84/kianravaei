                    <p>Composer <b>Kian Ravaei</b>‚Äôs eclectic interests have only multiplied since his adolescent years, which he spent playing jazz and folk music, producing EDM, and singing in a rock band‚Ä¶when he was supposed to be practicing piano sonatas. In the years since, his music has been performed by sought-after artists such as guitarist <a href="http://www.eliotfisk.com/" target="blank">Eliot Fisk</a> and violinist <a href="https://www.bellahristova.com/" target="blank">Bella Hristova</a>, and commissioned by notable organizations such as the <a href="https://cmccanada.org/" target="blank">Canadian Music Centre</a> and <a href="http://www.coplandhouse.org/" target="blank">Copland House</a>.</p>
                    <p>Just days into the COVID-19 lockdown, Ravaei began a daily ritual of playing a Bach chorale and composing an original chorale. What started as a way to ground himself during a period of emotional turbulence blossomed into an artistic reawakening. Over the course of one year and three hundred sixty-five chorales, Ravaei cultivated a deeply personal musical language, rooted in the same centuries-long tradition that informed countless composers from Beethoven to Bernstein.</p>
                    <p>A product of the internet age, Ravaei‚Äôs earliest compositions were electronic dance music tracks, which garnered hundreds of thousands of views on YouTube. He draws on his EDM production experience to compose genre-bending pieces like <i>Outcry</i>, in which the thrill of live instrumental performance meets the penetrating sounds of dubstep and drum & bass. Even his fully acoustic works contain a rhythmic vitality and transcendent yearning that evoke the energy of the dance floor. In recent months, established DJs <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wooli" target="blank">Wooli</a> and <a href="https://g.co/kgs/JDeesm" target="blank">Codeko</a> called on Ravaei to create a lush orchestral version of their rave anthem ‚Äú<a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/works/crazy/">Crazy (feat. Casey Cook)</a>‚Äù.</p>
                    <p>Born to Iranian immigrants, Ravaei maintains close ties to the Iranian community in his hometown of Los Angeles (or, as Iranians often call it, Tehrangeles). His multicultural arrangement of the Iranian folk song <i>Morgh-e Sahar</i> ‚Äî the unofficial anthem for Iranian freedom ‚Äî was performed at <a href="https://farhang.org/" target="blank">Farhang Foundation</a>‚Äôs annual Nowruz celebration, the largest Iranian New Year celebration outside Iran. A passionate speaker, Ravaei delivered a one-hour public lecture on the relationship between music and identity as part of the UCLA Iranian Music Lecture Series. In his work <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/works/family-photos/">Family Photos</a>, the ornamented melodies of Iranian classical music combine with imaginative sound-worlds, resulting in a refreshingly personal take on the string quartet.</p>
                    <p>Inspired by the generosity of his own teachers ‚Äî celebrated composers such as <a href="https://www.richard-danielpour.com/" target="blank">Richard Danielpour</a>, <a href="https://www.tarikoregan.com/" target="blank">Tarik O‚ÄôRegan</a>, and <a href="http://www.derekbermel.com/" target="blank">Derek Bermel</a> ‚Äî Ravaei pays forward his musical training by empowering youth to embrace their creativity. As a <a href="https://www.laco.org/people/kian-ravaei/" target="blank">Composer Teaching Artist Fellow</a> for the <a href="https://laco.org/" target="blank">Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra</a>, he taught historically underserved students about the diverse and growing repertoire of orchestral music. With Ravaei‚Äôs guidance, the students co-composed a piece of chamber music that was performed by professional musicians, empowering the students to have confidence in their creative voices.</p>
                    <p>Ravaei studied music composition at <a href="https://schoolofmusic.ucla.edu/" target="blank">UCLA</a> and the <a href="https://www.curtis.edu/" target="blank">Curtis Institute of Music</a> Young Artist Summer Program. He lives with his partner Tania ‚Äî a budding sociologist ‚Äî and their feline companion Mae.</p>

                    <p><b>Kian Ravaei</b> <a value="PLAY" onclick="play()">üîä</a> composes music that delivers heartfelt directness, bold melodies, and visceral power. His growing body of work has often been praised for combining rigorous compositional technique with naturalness and penetrating emotion.</p>
                    <p>During the first year of the pandemic, Ravaei‚Äôs daily ritual was playing a chorale by J.S. Bach at the piano and composing an original chorale. Three hundred seventy-one chorales later, Ravaei has cultivated a deeply personal harmonic language and an obsession with the art of counterpoint. Like Bach‚Äôs chorales, many of Ravaei‚Äôs works appear to be simple on the surface, but underneath they are rich and filled with unexpected nuance.</p>
                    <p>Born in 1999 of Iranian immigrants, Ravaei spent his childhood playing jazz, producing electronic dance music, and singing in a rock band when he should have been practicing piano sonatas. His diverse output has included a book of piano preludes inspired by mythical creatures, a string quartet that synthesizes Western and Persian classical music, and an orchestration for dubstep DJ and producer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wooli" target="_blank">Wooli</a>.</p>
                    <p>Ravaei‚Äôs music has been performed by leading musicians such as violinist <a href="https://www.bellahristova.com/" target="_blank">Bella Hristova</a>, guitarist <a href="http://jijiguitar.com/" target="_blank">JIJI</a>, and pianists <a href="https://www.stefanogreco.com/en/" target="_blank">Stefano Greco</a> and <a href="https://jihyechang.com/" target="_blank">Jihye Chang</a>. He has been commissioned by notable organizations and ensembles such as the <a href="https://cmccanada.org/" target="_blank">Canadian Music Centre</a> and <a href="https://www.salastina.org/" target="_blank">Salastina.</a></p>
                    <p>As of the 2021/22 season, Ravaei is a newly appointed <a href="https://www.laco.org/people/kian-ravaei/" target="_blank">Composer Teaching Artist Fellow</a> with the <a href="https://laco.org/" target="_blank">Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra</a>. He is an alum of the <a href="https://www.curtis.edu/" target="_blank">Curtis Institute of Music</a> Young Artist Summer Program, and he counts prominent composers such as <a href="https://www.tarikoregan.com/" target="_blank">Tarik O‚ÄôRegan</a>, <a href="https://www.derrickskye.com/" target="_blank">Derrick Skye</a>, <a href="https://kayrhie.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Kay Rhie</a>, and <a href="https://www.juanpablocontreras.com/" target="_blank">Juan Pablo Contreras</a> among his past mentors.</p>
                    <p>He makes his home in Los Angeles, where he studies music composition with <a href="https://www.richard-danielpour.com/" target="_blank">Richard Danielpour</a> ‚Äî one of his favorite living composers ‚Äî at the UCLA Herb Alpert School of Music. When he is not composing, he likes to jog, read short stories, and collect CDs.</p> -->
