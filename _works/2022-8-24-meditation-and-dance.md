The guitarist Shabyl Ajmal, for whom I wrote this piece, told me something amazing at the beginning of our collaboration: his late father was the first person to translate the _Masnavi_, an epic 50,000-line poem by the Persian poet Rumi, into the Malay language. For Shabyl and me, the _Masnavi_ became an intersection between his Malaysian heritage and my Persian heritage. The following passage provoked my imagination, bringing to mind the image of a Sufi dervish whirling rapturously in order to transcend his worldly desires.

<blockquote>
<p>
<span>Dance (only) where you break (mortify) yourself and (when you) tear away the cotton from the sore of lust.<br>
(Holy) men dance and wheel on the (spiritual) battle-field: they dance in their own blood.</span>
<cite>Rumi, <i>Masnavi</i> (trans. R.A. Nicholson)</cite>
</p>
