All seven titles which comprise _The Little Things_ come from Emily Dickinson, who never fails to direct our attention toward nature’s easily overlooked wonders. Movements II, III, IV, and VI evoke various animal life, while I and V portray the sun and moon respectively. The order of the movements suggests the cyclic journey of all living things from morning to night to a new morning.

In the final movement, we hear the voice of Nature singing Dickinson’s famous lines:

<blockquote>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p>If I can stop one heart from breaking,<br>
I shall not live in vain;<br>
If I can ease one life the aching,<br>
Or cool one pain,<br>
Or help one fainting robin<br>
Unto his nest again,<br>
I shall not live in vain.<br>
</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
