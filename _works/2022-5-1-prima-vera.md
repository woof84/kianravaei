“Primavera” is the Italian word for spring, and may also be translated literally as “first truth.” For me, spring brings to mind not only the springtime celebration of Easter, but also Nowruz, the Persian New Year celebration which begins on the spring equinox. Among several melodies of a celebratory character, I included one inspired by a mode of Iranian classical music called Chakâvak (“warbler”), which is thought to evoke birdsong—such as that which may be heard on a spring day.
