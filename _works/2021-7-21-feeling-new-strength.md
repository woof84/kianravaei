At the climax of his _Heiliger Dankgesang_, Beethoven writes “Neue Kraft fühlend” — feeling new strength. It is one of the only times Beethoven provides a poetic description in his manuscript.

These three words perfectly capture the musical spirit and expressive ideal I was chasing in composing this work: something joyous, optimistic, and life-affirming.
