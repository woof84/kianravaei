One of the most influential figures in Iranian classical music, Darvish Khān (1872–1926) was a prolific composer in addition to being a master of the traditional plucked string instruments _tār_ and _setār_. The term _chāhār mezrāb_ means a fast, étude-like piece, and _māhur indicates a collection of notes similar to the Western major scale. My arrangement preserves Darvish Khān’s melody, infusing it with Western harmonies while translating the techniques of _setār_-playing to the violin and cello.
