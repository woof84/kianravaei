<blockquote>
<p>
<span class="teaser">Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.<br>
Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.<br>
Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.<br>
Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled.<br>
Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.<br>
Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.<br>
Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called children of God.<br>
Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.<br>
