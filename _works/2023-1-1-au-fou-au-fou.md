After the premiere of Ravel’s _Boléro_, amidst the cheering crowd was a woman yelling “Au fou, au fou!” (“The madman, the madman!”). Ravel famously remarked that she was the only person who understood the piece. Like _Boléro_, this work inexorably builds on a single theme, inspired by Ravel’s use of repetition as a metaphor for madness.
