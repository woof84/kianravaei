Each of these lullabies is dedicated to a composer whose music brought me comfort as a child: Iranian composer Javad Maroufi, whose piano music my mother played on the piano; Mother Goose, whose lilting rhymes often lulled me to sleep; and Brahms, whose famous Wiegenlied (“Cradle Song”) played on my bedside music box.
