This piece is dedicated to my grandmother, Parvāneh, whose name means "butterfly" in Persian. Throughout her struggle with cancer, which is now in remission, I found myself imagining how it would feel to lose her, and what I would express in her eulogy. I wrote this music to capture those emotions while she is alive, rather than wait until she is no longer here to enjoy it.
