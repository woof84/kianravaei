This piece is dedicated to the memory of civil rights activist and Congressman John Lewis, who devoted his life to getting in “good trouble” for the sake of creating a more equitable society, one that epitomizes "love, brotherhood, and true peace."

The recording of _Good Trouble_ was released on the 59th anniversary of the March on Washington, where Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his “I Have A Dream” speech.
