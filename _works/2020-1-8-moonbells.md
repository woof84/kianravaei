<p class="teaser">This is one of those slow and meditative pieces of music which unfolds at a snail's pace.</p> 

But, in fact, its development is blistering in comparison to the duration of a complete lunar cycle. _Moonbells_ is a ten-minute microcosm of the monthly waxing and waning to which we are all witness.

Its title comes from a tiny Carl Sandburg poem called "Light and Moonbells". I have a feeling that the imaginary object represented by the combination of the words "moon" and "bell" is ultimately what this piece aims to depict.
