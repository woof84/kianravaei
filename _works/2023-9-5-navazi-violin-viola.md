_Navazi_ is a collection of composed improvisations inspired by the _kamancheh_, a traditional Iranian bowed string instrument resembling a Western fiddle. The title is a Persian word meaning both "to play an instrument" and "to caress." Each movement draws from different sections of _Dastgah-e Nava_, one of the musical modes in Iranian classical music: _Daramad_ ("Arise"), _Nahoft_ ("Hide"), _Khojaste_ ("Rejoice"), and _Forud_ ("Return").

_Note: The four movements are intended to be interspersed between other pieces on a concert program, rather than performed consecutively._
