My daily ritual during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic was to play a Bach chorale and compose an original chorale. This piece spins together several of my chorales, offering a fresh interpretation of the chorale fantasia genre which originates from the Baroque period. Transmutations of Bach’s “O Sacred Head” chorale (from the _St Matthew Passion_) bookend the composition.
