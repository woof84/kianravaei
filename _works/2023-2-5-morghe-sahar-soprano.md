One of the most celebrated Iranian ballads, _Morghe Sahar (Bird of Dawn)_ is widely regarded as the unofficial anthem for Iranian freedom. Its lyrics were conceived in response to the Iranian Constitutional Revolution of the early 20th-century, but present-day Iranians sing it as a rallying cry against Iran’s tyrannical government—hoping that one day a bird of dawn will arise from the darkness of the night.

My arrangement is a tribute to the “Woman, Life, Freedom” movement, and dedicated to the memory of Jina Mahsa Amini. By adding harmony to a traditionally monophonic song, I sought to shroud the melody in a mournful veil, reflecting the sorrow of an oppressed people.
