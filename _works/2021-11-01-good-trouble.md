This piece is dedicated to the memory of John Lewis, who, in his roles as civil rights activist and Congressman, dedicated his life to stirring up “good trouble” in order to create world-shaking social change.

The listening menu includes stride bass, bustling dovetailed arpeggios, triumphant cello power chords, and plenty of good ol' fashioned counterpoint.

<!-- We recorded the musicians in separate isolation booths to achieve a crisp, in-your-face sound. -->
