Shādi, which means “joy” or “festivity” in Persian, takes inspiration from two particularly joyful dance forms found in Iranian classical music. The first is a _Chāhārmezrāb_, typically performed on a plucked string instrument and characterized by light, nimble melodies. The second is a _Reng_, a lively dance in a moderately fast tempo that often culminates a performance of Iranian classical music. In the manner of a fantasy, this piece combines these dance forms with lyrical interludes and exuberant outbursts, aspiring to the unique brand of joy which exists solely in the Iranian music repertoire.
