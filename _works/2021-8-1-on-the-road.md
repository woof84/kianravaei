Inspired by Jack Kerouac’s landmark novel as well as my own experiences traversing the U.S., _On the Road_ is about the American road trip as a journey of self-discovery. The reed quintet is accompanied by steel-string acoustic guitar, infusing the piece with the rustic, twangy sound of American folk music.

I tried to evoke the feeling of driving along the highway by maintaining the same tempo for the entire piece—except the ending. I couldn’t hold myself back from speeding toward the finish line.
